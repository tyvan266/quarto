They are used to track a dynamic population over time, one where individuals may enter and leave at different times, and they are important for computing **at-risk** rates. In this post, we will demonstrate how to compute simple life table summaries.\n\nSuppose we have patient data on enrollment start times and censoring or death times. For simplicity, instead of using R *date types*, we will represent start and end times as numeric integers. This set up is very similar to our first post on *gaps and islands*.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npatient_fup_data <- \n  tibble(\n    ID             = 1:200, \n    startFollowUp  = c(sample(1:200, 200, replace = TRUE)),\n    endDeathCensor = startFollowUp + sample(30:100, 200, replace = TRUE)  \n  )\n\n\nhead(patient_fup_data, n = 10) |> kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| ID| startFollowUp| endDeathCensor|\n|--:|-------------:|--------------:|\n|  1|           105|            185|\n|  2|           140|            234|\n|  3|            38|            115|\n|  4|            30|             76|\n|  5|           153|            252|\n|  6|           184|            267|\n|  7|           199|            270|\n|  8|             5|             82|\n|  9|            22|             92|\n| 10|           173|            228|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nRoughly, we can visualize when new patients enter and when they leave (due to death or censoring or exiting our risk set).

Suppose we assess counts every 60 time units. In the code below, the cartesian join will match every row in the left table (our reference grid points) with every row in the right table (our patient data). Then we make an indicator for if the patient's observation window intersects the grid point, and group by time and sum them up:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurvival_grid <- tibble(xtime = seq(0, 500, 60))\n\nsurv_grid_xpatients <- survival_grid |> cross_join(patient_fup_data)\n\nsurvival_grid_counts <- \nsurv_grid_xpatients |> \n  mutate(count = startFollowUp <= xtime & endDeathCensor >= xtime) |> \n  group_by(xtime) |> \n  summarise(count = sum(count))\n\n\nhead(survival_grid_counts) |> kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| xtime| count|\n|-----:|-----:|\n|     0|     0|\n|    60|    49|\n|   120|    62|\n|   180|    64|\n|   240|    31|\n|   300|     0|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\nWithin the cartesian join, observe each patient can only contribute one count towards each grid time point.\n:::\n\n## (approximately) Continuous method -- Map to the rescue\n\nIn this method, we do a rolling count moving through each patient. Eventually we subset on unique entry times where a change in the total population can possibly occur. In particular, at each entry time when one or more new patients enroll, we add up the total number of enrollees (a simple row count works here as we cycle through the patient data set). But we must adjust at each entry the total number lost to death or censoring up to that point. As more than one patient may enter at the same time, the final counts appear last when grouped by entry times and provided we start counting in order beginning from the earliest entry.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN_under_observation <- \npatient_fup_data |> \n  arrange(startFollowUp) |> \n  \n  mutate(\n    Nenroll = row_number(), \n    Nlost   = map_dbl(startFollowUp, \\(.x) sum(endDeathCensor <= .x)), \n    N_obs   = Nenroll - Nlost \n  ) |> \n  \n  group_by(startFollowUp) |> \n  slice(n()) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFinally, we visualize the change in our patient population size over time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot(N_under_observation, aes(x = startFollowUp, y = N_obs)) + \n  geom_step(size = 1) + \n  xlab(\"Time\") + \n  ylab(\"Number under observation\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 16, angle = 45),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 18), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 24),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 24),\n    legend.position = 'right'\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Population size over time](post_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=1440}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere is a caveat with our solution. We are not accounting for exit times that occur *between* two successive entry times. This might be okay as the total lost will be factored in at the later entry date, but if the time until a new enrollment is long, it can be misleading of the population size at risk, particularly if there was a large drop-off somewhere in-between. Related to this, we are also not seeing when everyone exits (population at risk becomes zero). These should be kept in mind when interpreting and communicating the information presented in the figure.\n",
